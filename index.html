		<div><b>First</b> <b>impression</b></h2></div>
		<p>When I first came to this school, I thought this school was 
		very small.However, there have much more students than I 
		thought. Teachers and students are friendly and kind. This 
		comfort my anxious feelings a lot. Besides the school, there 
		have beautiful environment and views, which brought me a good 
		impression.</p>

		<div><b>Things</b> <b>I</b> <b>was afraid about</b></h2>
		<p>After moved to this school, there have many problems 
		happened. For example: I cannot adapt the dorm life quickly, 
		hard to get used to staying in school every day, unfamiliar with
		classmates.etc.</p>

		<div><b>Expectations</b></h2>
		<p>My expectation for studying in CICT is to study hard, get 
		along with each other well, take every day seriously and cherish
		the time in here.</p>

		<div><b>Adaption</b> <b>for</b> <b>dorm life</b></h2>
		<p>After I move into the dorm, I met my new roommate. Even though
		we were not familiar with each other very well, with only a few
		communications. However, as time passes, we become a close 
		friend and tell one another everything. Because of my friends,
	    I gradually become no longer afraid and lonely anymore.</p>

	    <div><b>Everday</b> <b>day</b> <b>school life</b></h2>
	    <p>Everyday morning, we prepare ourselves and get on the bus on 
	    time. After arrived at school and ate breakfast, we start our 
	    first class. After all of the classes finished is our club time.
	    We have a lot of fun and also learn a lot of knowledge outside 
	    of our lessons.</p>

	    <p>The school always prepare good meals for us. In the morning,
	    there will have many different kinds of breakfast for you to 
	    choose. For example: traditional Taiwanese breakfast, cereal,

	    <div><b>Club</b> <b>time</b></h2>
	    <p>At 3 o'clock, it's our club time. The club I chose is the 
	    magic club and coffee club. In the magic club, we will get the
	    props and learn three to four magic tricks. In the coffee club,
	    we will learn to make a type of drink. Not only the coffee but 
	    also tea drink.</p>

	     have a great dinner. Especially after those five days, I will
	     become more cherish the days with my family. These are the only
